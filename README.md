Hi there 👋, My name is Mthobisi Latha.

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about technology, data, and innovation. Here's a little bit about me:

🔧 Currently Working On: End-to-end machine learning projects, including building neural networks and implementing machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes and Gradient Boosting Machines. I'm also exploring computer vision tasks with datasets like the CIFAR-10 dataset.

🌱 Currently Learning: Advanced deep learning concepts, data engineering pipelines, and hands-on projects using TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. I'm also diving into the world of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs).

🔗 Looking to Collaborate On: Machine learning, deep learning, and data science projects, especially those focusing on real-world applications like email spam detection, image recognition, and predictive modeling.

🤔 Looking for Help With: Expanding my skills in optimizing machine learning models for performance and scalability. I’m also keen to learn best practices for deploying AI models in production environments.

💬 Ask Me About: Python, machine learning, neural networks, or even tips on using TensorFlow/Keras effectively! I’m always excited to share insights and learn from others.
